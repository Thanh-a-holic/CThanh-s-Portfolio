# EASY Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a demand forecasting and inventory optimization system. The goal is to predict future product demand and optimize inventory levels to minimize costs and maximize service levels.

## Features
- **Demand Forecasting**: Uses historical sales data to predict future demand.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Determines optimal inventory levels to balance holding costs and stockout risks.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visual insights into sales trends and inventory performance.
